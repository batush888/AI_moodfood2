# AI Mood-Based Food Recommendation System üçΩÔ∏èüß†

An innovative AI-powered food recommendation system that understands your eating mood and situational needs expressed in natural language, moving beyond traditional cuisine-based search to provide truly personalized food suggestions.

## üåü What Makes This System Special?

Instead of browsing rigid categories like "Pizza" or "Sushi," users describe their eating mood and situation:

- **"I want something light"** ‚Üí Smoothies, salads, light soups
- **"I'm feeling cold and want something warm"** ‚Üí Hot pot, ramen, beef stew
- **"I want something romantic for a couple's date"** ‚Üí Oysters, chocolate fondue, wine pairings
- **"I'm craving something sweet/spicy/salty"** ‚Üí Desserts, spicy dishes, savory snacks
- **"I want something comforting because I'm tired/sick"** ‚Üí Chicken soup, mac and cheese, pudding

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Mood-Based Taxonomy ‚úÖ
- **Weather-based**: Hot/cold weather food preferences
- **Energy-based**: Light/heavy/greasy food choices
- **Emotional**: Comfort, romantic, celebratory food
- **Flavor profile**: Sweet, spicy, salty, umami preferences
- **Occasion-based**: Family dinner, lunch break, party snacks
- **Health-based**: Recovery, detox, gentle digestion

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Recommendation Engine ‚úÖ
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Intent classification and mood extraction
- **Context Awareness**: Time, weather, location, social context
- **Smart Matching**: Mood-to-food mapping with vector similarity
- **Restaurant Integration**: Rating, reviews, delivery, proximity
- **Personalization**: User preferences and feedback learning
- **Ranking & Clustering**: Multi-factor scoring and result organization

## üöÄ Quick Start

## üì° API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

#### `POST /recommend` - Get Food Recommendations
```json
{
  "user_input": "I want something warm and comforting",
  "user_context": {
    "weather": "cold",
    "time_of_day": "evening",
    "social_context": "alone"
  },
  "user_id": "user123",
  "top_k": 10
}
```

#### `POST /analyze-mood` - Analyze User Intent
```json
{
  "user_input": "I'm feeling hot and need something refreshing",
  "context": {
    "weather": "hot",
    "time_of_day": "afternoon"
  }
}
```

#### `GET /taxonomy` - View Mood Categories
Returns all available mood categories with descriptors and example foods.

#### `GET /examples` - Get Example Queries
Provides sample queries for each mood category to help users understand the system.

### Personalization Endpoints

#### `POST /preferences` - Update User Preferences
```json
{
  "user_id": "user123",
  "preferences": {
    "preferred_categories": ["EMOTIONAL_COMFORT", "FLAVOR_SPICY"],
    "preferred_tags": ["comforting", "spicy", "warm"],
    "preferred_cultures": ["Italian", "Indian"],
    "price_range": "$$",
    "delivery_preferred": true
  }
}
```

#### `POST /feedback` - Submit Feedback
```json
{
  "user_id": "user123",
  "food_item_id": "curry_001",
  "rating": 4.5,
  "feedback": "Excellent recommendation! Perfect for my mood."
}
```

## üß† How It Works

### 1. Intent Understanding
The system analyzes natural language input to extract:
- **Primary mood**: Main emotional or situational need
- **Secondary moods**: Additional context and preferences
- **Entities**: Weather, time, social context, health status

### 2. Mood Mapping
Uses vector similarity to map user intent to predefined mood categories:
- Creates mood vectors from taxonomy labels
- Combines primary, secondary, and context vectors
- Finds best-matching food categories

### 3. Food Matching
Matches mood categories to food items using:
- **Direct category matching**: Exact mood category alignment
- **Label matching**: Semantic label similarity
- **Tag matching**: Characteristic tag alignment
- **Context matching**: Time, weather, social appropriateness

### 4. Restaurant Integration
Finds suitable restaurants by:
- **Mood category alignment**: Restaurant mood compatibility
- **Context matching**: Price, delivery, location preferences
- **Quality metrics**: Ratings, reviews, popularity

### 5. Ranking & Personalization
Final scoring combines:
- **Mood match score** (40%): How well food fits the mood
- **Context match score** (30%): Appropriateness for situation
- **Restaurant quality** (20%): Ratings, reviews, features
- **Personalization** (10%): User preferences and history

## üìä Example Queries & Responses
